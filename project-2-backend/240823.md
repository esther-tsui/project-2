# Login

Using flask-jwt and flask-Bcrypt,

create a login route that is a POST route (/api/v1/login.)

This POST route should take a JSON payload of 
```
{
    "username": string,
    "password": string,
}
```

Firstly, check if a user with the username exists in our database
If no such user exists, return the error, else fetch the user.

Now, using flask-bcrypt, check the hash of the provided password in the payload to make sure that it is equal to that of the stored bcrypt hash in the database.
